## Product Vision

At online conferences, meaningful connections and direct conversations
are lost. Thus, to enhance net-working, we built a virtual space in form
of a map, allowing users to walk in and out of conversations as naturally
as in real life - where interactions are solemnly based on one's interest.

Making the breaks between sessions more fun and opening up possibilities
for new connections.


## Elevator Pitch

This is a mobile app that allows online conferences attendees
to interact with each other through chatrooms. This gives them a better
experience, keeping direct interactions alive.


## Requirements

The application should give the user the opportunity to choose his interests so that the map shows appealing topics. Hence the exhibited topics should lead to chatrooms where the users can communicate. It should be possible to leave the chatrooms. A user can create a new topic, giving him responsability for its chatroom management.

### Use case diagram

![Use case diagram](useCases.png)

- **Navigate the Map**
> **Actor**: Attendee  
> **Description**: The application directs the attendee to a personalized map view, showing points of interest in the form of discussion topics related to his interests.  
> **Preconditions**: Attendee has logged in / signed up successfully.  
> **Postconditions**: Attendee can choose whether he wants to join a chatroom (and which one) or whether he wants to access his personal space and exit the app.   

> **Normal Flow**:
  1. The application shows a map, containing different active chatrooms.
  2. The attendee is able to choose which chatroom to join.
  3. The App bar contains the person icon, through which the user can access his personal space.

> **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**: The user doesn't find any themes interesting -> The user can refresh the map. The user doesn't find a topic he really wanted to discuss -> He can create a new chatroom. 

- **Chatroom**
> **Actor**: Attendee  
> **Description**: The attendee enters a chatroom.  
> **Preconditions**: Attendee has chosen the topic he wants to discuss.  
> **Postconditions**: Attende can text the other chatroom participants. Attendee can leave the chatroom whenever he wants. Attendee can save information about other user.

The main entities created for our app were the following:

![Domain Model diagram](domainModel.png)

In the navigation map, we have access to the several chatrooms created. Every user may choose to enter one chatroom at a time. Messages sent to a chatroom are stored for everyone who might come to enter said chatroom to see, and are always associated to the user who sent them.

A **user** can create an account in the application, by setting up his username, email, password and other personal information which will appear in his profile.  
The **user** must choose his interests, in order to have a personalized experience. Each **interest** may be common to many users, and it represents a theme for a **chatroom** that may already exist. If not, the **user**, as a **chatroom moderator**, can create a new theme for a **chatroom**. Once there are participants in a **chatroom**, there can exist an unlimited number of **messages**. Each **message** can be send by a single **user**, inside a single **chatroom**, and its date, time and text associated.

## Architecture and Design

### Logical architecture

![Logical Architecture diagram](logicalArchitecture.png)

### Physical architecture

![physical architecture](physicalArch.png)

![logical architecture](/docs/logicalArch.png)

The structure of our project is based on the MVC model. In short, the MVC specifies that the application consists of a **Model** that directly manages the data, the **View** is the display of the information, and the **Controller** is where the inputs are accepted and converted into commands.  

### Physical architecture
![physical architecture](/docs/physical.png)

We chose flutter as our framework to develop our project.  
As it is easy to integrate with flutter, we chose Firebase for database management and backend server.  
Our physical architecture isn't complex. The users install the application on their smartphones and it communicates with the firebase server via https requests, which is where the database is stored.  

### Prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe in more detail which, and how, user(s) story(ies) were implemented.

## Implementation
Regular product increments are a good practice of product management.

While not necessary, sometimes it might be useful to explain a few aspects of the code that have the greatest potential to confuse software engineers about how it works. Since the code should speak by itself, try to keep this section as short and simple as possible.

Use cross-links to the code repository and only embed real fragments of code when strictly needed, since they tend to become outdated very soon.

---
## Test

There are several ways of documenting testing activities, and quality assurance in general, being the most common: a strategy, a plan, test case specifications, and test checklists.

In this section it is only expected to include the following:
* test plan describing the list of features to be tested and the testing methods and tools;
* test case specifications to verify the functionalities, using unit tests and acceptance tests.

A good practice is to simplify this, avoiding repetitions, and automating the testing actions as much as possible.

---
## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a projectâs artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

## Project management

To manage the progress of this project, we are using [Github Projects](https://github.com/FEUP-ESOF-2020-21/open-cx-t5g4-techgals/projects/1).
