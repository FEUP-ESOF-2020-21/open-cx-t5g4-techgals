## Product Vision

At online conferences, meaningful connections and direct conversations
are lost. Thus, to enhance net-working, we built a virtual space in form
of a map, allowing users to walk in and out of conversations as naturally
as in real life - where interactions are solemnly based on one's interest.

Making the breaks between sessions more fun and opening up possibilities
for new connections.


## Elevator Pitch

This is a mobile app that allows online conference attendees
to interact with each other through chatrooms. This gives them a better
experience, keeping direct interactions alive.


## Requirements

The application should give the user the opportunity to choose his interests so that the map shows appealing topics. Hence the exhibited topics should lead to chatrooms where the users can communicate. It should be possible to leave the chatrooms. A user can create a new topic, giving him responsability for its chatroom management.

### Use case diagram

> **Actor**: Attendee  
> **Description**: This use case exists so that, at online conferences or during a break, the attendee can enter the application.  
> **Preconditions and Postconditions**: In order to sign in, the attendee must have an account. If not, he can create one. In the end, the user must have full access to the application   functionalities.   

> **Normal Flow**:    
  1. The attendee signs in.  
  2. The application validates email/password.  
  3. The application will ask for user's interests.   
  or  
  1. The attendee creates an account.  
  2. The application asks for personal information such as the email and password.  
  3. The application will ask for user's interests.  

> **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**: The user types his personal information -> the application doesn't recognize the email/password -> the application emits error message.   

- **Choose interests**  
> **Actor**: Attendee  
> **Description**: The application asks the user to set his interests.  
> **Preconditions and Postconditions**: In order to choose his interests, the user must first register and sign in. In the end, the user must be able to see a personalized map.

  1. The application asks the user to set his interests.  
  2. The application validates the interests entered by the attendee.  

- **Navigate the Map**
> **Actor**: Attendee  
> **Description**: The application directs the attendee to a personalized map view, showing points of interest in the form of discussion topics related to his interests.  
> **Preconditions and Postconditions**: In order to view the map, the attendee must have set his interests and personal information with success. In the end, the attendee can chose the chatrooms, represented on the map, he wants to join.  

> **Normal Flow**:
  1. The attendee has set his interests and personal information with success.
  2. The application shows a personalized map, showing discussion topics of interest.
  3. The attendee is able to choose any of the themes that lead to their respective chatroom.

> **Alternative Flows and Exceptions**: The user doesn't find a topic he really wanted to discuss -> He can create a new chatroom.  

- **Enter Chatroom**

### Domain model

To better understand the context of the software system, it is very useful to have a simple UML class diagram with all the key concepts (names, attributes) and relationships involved of the problem domain addressed by your module.

---

## Architecture and Design
The architecture of a software system encompasses the set of key decisions about its overall organization.

A well written architecture document is brief but reduces the amount of time it takes new programmers to a project to understand the code to feel able to make modifications and enhancements.

To document the architecture requires describing the decomposition of the system in their parts (high-level components) and the key behaviors and collaborations between them.

In this section you should start by briefly describing the overall components of the project and their interrelations. You should also describe how you solved typical problems you may have encountered, pointing to well-known architectural and design patterns, if applicable.

### Logical architecture
The purpose of this subsection is to document the high-level logical structure of the code, using a UML diagram with logical packages, without the worry of allocating to components, processes or machines.

It can be beneficial to present the system both in a horizontal or vertical decomposition:
* horizontal decomposition may define layers and implementation concepts, such as the user interface, business logic and concepts;
* vertical decomposition can define a hierarchy of subsystems that cover all layers of implementation.

### Physical architecture
![physical architecture](/docs/physical.png)


### Prototype
To help on validating all the architectural, design and technological decisions made, we usually implement a vertical prototype, a thin vertical slice of the system.

In this subsection please describe in more detail which, and how, user(s) story(ies) were implemented.

---

## Implementation
Regular product increments are a good practice of product management.

While not necessary, sometimes it might be useful to explain a few aspects of the code that have the greatest potential to confuse software engineers about how it works. Since the code should speak by itself, try to keep this section as short and simple as possible.

Use cross-links to the code repository and only embed real fragments of code when strictly needed, since they tend to become outdated very soon.

---
## Test

There are several ways of documenting testing activities, and quality assurance in general, being the most common: a strategy, a plan, test case specifications, and test checklists.

In this section it is only expected to include the following:
* test plan describing the list of features to be tested and the testing methods and tools;
* test case specifications to verify the functionalities, using unit tests and acceptance tests.

A good practice is to simplify this, avoiding repetitions, and automating the testing actions as much as possible.

---
## Configuration and change management

Configuration and change management are key activities to control change to, and maintain the integrity of, a projectâs artifacts (code, models, documents).

For the purpose of ESOF, we will use a very simple approach, just to manage feature requests, bug fixes, and improvements, using GitHub issues and following the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).


---

## Project management

Software project management is an art and science of planning and leading software projects, in which software projects are planned, implemented, monitored and controlled.

In the context of ESOF, we expect that each team adopts a project management tool capable of registering tasks, assign tasks to people, add estimations to tasks, monitor tasks progress, and therefore being able to track their projects.

Example of tools to do this are:
  * [Trello.com](https://trello.com)
  * [Github Projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/com)
  * [Pivotal Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com)
  * [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira)

We recommend to use the simplest tool that can possibly work for the team.
